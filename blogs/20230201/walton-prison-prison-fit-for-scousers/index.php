        <h1>Walton Prison: A Prison un-fit for rats</h1>


        <p>In 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022 Walton prison was subject to unannounced investigations each time calling it the
            worst prison in Britain finding it overcrowded, dirty, dangerous and inhumane.</p>


        <p>Only during the 2022 inspection did the population drop below 1100 to 800 by closing one wing to make
            improvements demanded 7 years prior, a damning observation when we remind ourselves that the whole prison is
            only designed to hold a population of 750.</p>


        <p>Prisoners are treated inhumanely as a process, it’s reported no matter how prisoners arrive be that for
            permanent stay or transfer they are strip searched and degraded.</p>


        <p>Prisoners at risk of self harm or suicide are still not given the attention and support needed; being locked
            in their cell for 23 hours a day, requests to see doctors and GP’s being purposely delayed and the
            dispensing of medication and appointments being delayed or cancelled out right.</p>


        <p>When asked to produce information about prisoners who posed a risk to the public or themselves on release
            prison management were unable to share information.</p>


        <p>Prisoners are regularly beaten and left to fester in filthy cockroach ridden cells.<br>Cells that have broken
            furniture, broken windows and little to no privacy.<br>It’s common for prisoners to tear up their own bed
            sheets and clothes to create curtains and separations for some semblance of privacy in these overcrowded
            living spaces.</p>


        <p>And it’s here we see the folly of a prison and rehabilitation system under capitalism, a system that treats
            and teaches its population that it thinks of them as nothing more than capital, sent to repay a debt and be
            released with no care for the human life in their responsibility.</p>
